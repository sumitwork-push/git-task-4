It's gonna happen tonight
I'm gonna make you feel right
'Cause you're in Hollywood
Where the feels are good
No matter what you have done
Let's wait the morning to come
We're in Hollywood
Where the feels are good

Maybe you're taking too wrong
Maybe you're getting too high
I only do what I should
But you're in Hollywood
